            <p id="desc">Hello! I'm Paul Wiskow, an aspiring programmer and engineer currently studying in my second year at the University of Virginia.<br>I am pursuing my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

                In my second year at UVA, I have been<br>actively involved with UVA Rocketry, where I serve as a co-lead for the electronics team. I take pride in contributing to the development<br>of our payload computer by overseeing both the wiring and coding processes. Additionally, I've coded the GUI and logic for the<br>ground station computer. Furthermore, I successfully built and flew my own level one Tripoli rocket, earning my level one certification.<br>
                
                Beyond academics, I find joy in various activities such as working out, spending time with friends, and immersing myself in strategy<br>board games and video games, particularly Catan and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.
                
                I am open to any opportunities for personal and<br>professional growth. Feel free to reach out to me at paulwiskow@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am excited to<br>continue my journey as a programmer and engineer, making a positive impact in my field.</p>
