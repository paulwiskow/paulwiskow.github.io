            <p id="desc">Hello! I'm Paul Wiskow, an aspiring programmer and engineer currently studying in my second year at the University of Virginia. I am pursuing my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

                In my second year at UVA, I have been actively involved with UVA Rocketry, where I serve as a co-lead for the electronics team. I take pride in contributing to the development of our payload computer by overseeing both the wiring and coding processes. Additionally, I've coded the GUI and logic for the ground station computer. Furthermore, I successfully built and flew my own level one Tripoli rocket, earning my level one certification.
                
                Beyond academics, I find joy in various activities such as working out, spending time with friends, and immersing myself in strategy board games and video games, particularly Catan and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.
                
                I am open to any opportunities for personal and professional growth. Feel free to reach out to me at paulwiskow@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am excited to continue my journey as a programmer and engineer, making a positive impact in my field.</p>
